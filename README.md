## Description

Haven is a resource management and survival game in the same vein as The Oregon Trail. The goal of the game is to reach Haven safely, before a horde of humanoid coyotes with a penchant for violence, and unquenchable bloodlust catches up to you. During your travels, you must manage your crystals  and Hit Points (HP) to ensure you reach Haven. Along the way, you will be met by many encounters that affect your resources and travel plans.

##The Game
